# Employee-Management-System---MySQL
### Project Description

The **Employee Management System** is a robust database solution designed to streamline and manage employee information within an organization. This system utilizes MySQL for efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. The primary focus is on managing employee details, tracking their job titles over time, and recording bonuses awarded to them. 

The project features a well-structured database schema with three main tables:

1. **Worker**: Stores fundamental information about each employee, including their ID, name, salary, joining date, and department.
2. **Title**: Records the titles held by employees and the dates from which these titles are effective.
3. **Bonus**: Keeps track of bonuses awarded to employees, including the amount and date of each bonus.

This system enables the execution of a variety of SQL queries to perform different types of data analysis and reporting, such as listing all employees, tracking salary distribution across departments, and analyzing bonus patterns.

Key functionalities provided by the Employee Management System include:

- **Employee Records Management**: Easily add, update, and retrieve employee details.
- **Title Tracking**: Maintain a history of job titles held by employees and the effective dates.
- **Bonus Management**: Record and analyze bonuses awarded to employees.

The project is designed to help HR departments and management teams maintain an organized and easily accessible record of all employee-related data, facilitating better decision-making and streamlined HR operations.

By leveraging MySQL, this system ensures data integrity, efficient querying, and scalability, making it suitable for organizations of varying sizes.
